# ALX Airbnb Clone Setup

This project is part of the ALX Frontend Specialization. It scaffolds a simplified Airbnb-like platform using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

- `components/` – Reusable UI components (e.g., `Card`, `Pill`, `Button`)
- `interfaces/` – TypeScript interfaces for props
- `public/` – Static files (e.g., images)

## Key Features

- Modular components with props for reusability
- Dynamic Pill and Button components
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS

npm install
npm run dev -- -p 3000
Then visit: http://localhost:3000/landing
